    <!--The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. 
        The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. 
It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name.
 Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader".
     This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:
        
    
    A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:-->




    <h1 id="myheader">My Header</h1>
