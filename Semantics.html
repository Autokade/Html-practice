    <!--A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

    <!--Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>-->

    <!--The <section> element defines a section in a document.

        According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
        
        Examples of where a <section> element can be used:
        
        Chapters
        Introduction
        News items
        Contact information
        A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.-->

    <section>
      <h1>WWF</h1>
      <p>

        working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration
        of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was
        founded in 1961.
      </p>

      <h1>WWf's panda symbol</h1>
      <p>

        WWF.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!--The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

Forum posts
Blog posts
User comments
Product cards
Newspaper articles-->
