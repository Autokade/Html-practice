    <!--Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element.-->
    




    <!--Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.-->
    <h1><span style="border: 1px solid black;background-color: aqua;">Your ass</span></h1>



    <!--The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:-->



    <div style="background-color: black;color: white;padding: 10px;">
        <H2>London</H2>
        <p style="color: greenyellow;">london mein sex hoya</p>

    </div>




    <!--The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:-->
    <h1>My parents</h1>
    <p>My mother has <span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">Blue eyes</span> and My father has <span style="color: darkgreen;font-weight: bold;">Dark green eyes</span></p>
